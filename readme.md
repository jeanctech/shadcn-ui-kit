## What is Xml?

Xml, which stands for "Extensible Markup Language" in English, is translated into Spanish as "Extensible Markup Language" or simply "Xml" for its Spanish acronym. It is a standard that defines rules for encoding text documents in a way that is readable by both humans and machines. Xml is used to represent data in a structured manner and is widely used in various applications, from representing data on the web to configuring applications and exchanging information between systems.

XML, which stands for "Extensible Markup Language", is a standard that defines rules for encoding text documents in a way that is readable by both humans and machines. It was designed to be self-descriptive and easily readable, making it ideal for representing structured data. Here is a basic introduction to Xml.

## Important information and frequently asked questions

Currently the course is in process. The basic, intermediate and backend blocks have been started, and that was the initial objective of the project. And after that I don't rule out adding new lessons in the future, but I think that for the moment it can serve as a basis for anyone who wants to start learning this language.

* As soon as the course continues, I will update the repository and notify the networks.
Thank you very much for all the support shown!
